# CT Kidney Classification

Our project involves the classification of kidney images from CT scans into different categories such as healthy, cystic, tumors, or other pathologies using deep learning techniques. The dataset used consists of CT scan images that are labeled for training and evaluation.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can automatically classify CT kidney scans into predefined categories. This would be useful for assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosing kidney-related diseases more efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing consists of labeled CT kidney images. It includes various classes of kidney diseases such as:

- Healthy kidneys
- Cystic kidneys
- Kidney tumors
- Other pathologies (e.g., kidney stones)
